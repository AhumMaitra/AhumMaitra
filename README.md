  ## Little information about me
  ** I am Ahum Maitra, a young and passionate learner with a deep interest in technology, languages, and creative projects. My journey into the world of computers and coding began when I was just six years old, with the gift of my first laptop. This sparked my curiosity, and I started exploring video editing on mobile platforms, which eventually led me to dive deeper into web development, AI, and programming. Over the years, I have taught myself various skills, from designing websites to coding in multiple languages.

One of my proudest accomplishments is my YouTube channel, where I teach English to others. I love sharing my knowledge with people and helping them learn new things. Along with that, I have created several websites, including an English blog, a course platform, a computer education site, and my personal website, where I showcase my skills and projects.

I have always been fascinated by artificial intelligence, and one of my big dreams is to become an AI engineer. I constantly seek new ways to improve my understanding of AI, coding, and the latest technological advancements. This passion has driven me to work on many creative projects, such as building a fictional planet called 'Planet AM,' where time runs faster than Earth, or designing unique animations and stylish effects for my websites.

Apart from technology, I actively participate in various school events and competitions. Recently, I won first place in an impromptu speech contest and second place in a debate on the harmful effects of plastic usage. I enjoy challenging myself with these activities, as they help me grow and improve my communication skills.

In addition to my love for coding and design, I value sharing my journey, which is why I often write blogs about the things I love, such as my programming experiences and personal milestones.

With a passion for learning, creating, and sharing knowledge, I continue to pursue my dreams and build upon my skills, always eager to see where my journey will take me next.
